<p>Technical documentation is a vital part of the product lifecycle. Good documentation acts as a bridge between the product and the end-user. The technical writers act as the user advocates and create the documents for the end-users. Producing technically accurate and user-friendly documentation requires a well-formed process that covers the documentation development life cycle (DDLC) stages.</p>
<p>Here, we have a collaborative process that includes our offshore team as well as the client. The stages involved are - planning and design, content development, offline reviews, technical reviews, QC stages, pre-publishing, and publishing. We use Enovia, a product lifecycle management tool for tracking and approvals, JIRA for bug tracking, and Confluence for collaboration with developers. Oxygen XML editor is used as an authoring tool.</p>
<p>Once the client provides the RSA document to the assigned writer, they analyze the requirements and creates the doc plan. The doc plan document contains the audience analysis, type of output delivery, the scope of documentation for the release, and the schedule for later stages. Before moving to the next phase, the product management team should approve the doc plan. The writer creates a high-level doc structure in the design phase and identifies the base source file version, etc.</p>
<p>The writer starts developing the content for the release in the content development phase. Once completing each chapter, the writer does the self-review to confirm the style guidelines are met and then sends for a peer-review. Once the review comments are addressed, these chapters are uploaded to the Confluence pages for an SME review. The review cycle continues until the scope is met. After the offline review, chapters are integrated into the DITA map, and output is generated. The output generated is uploaded to the Confluence page for technical review. After incorporating the technical comments, the updated document is submitted for the QC stages. The editor makes sure that each writer adheres to the style guidelines.</p>
<p>The final output and source files are handed over to the client for review in the pre-publishing stage. In this stage, the client team reviews the document, integrates the source file to the CMS, and provides feedback. Once they approve, the document is published to the documentation portal.</p>
