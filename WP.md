# White paper on Content Manager
## Table of Contents
## Introduction
Content Management System is an application tool which helps to organise and publish web contents. The contents in CMS are stored in a database and are displayed to the users based on the search results or classification. The contents can be organised and displayed based on templates using a CMS. Currently, cloud-based CMS are available where the contents are stored in any of the cloud platforms so the availability of the content can be widened. CMS helps with the creation, storage, validation and publishing of the contents.
Content Manager is a content management tool which helps to create, amend, organise and publish articles in the Knowledge Library. It helps to ensure that the articles published in the Knowledge Library are consistent, presentable and up to date. It also helps with the versioning of the article. It is a web-based HTML editor tool, which provides an output – “what you see is what you get”. You can only publish the articles to the Knowledge Library with the help of Content Manager. Most of the articles are provided with access rights, and the customers will only be able to access these articles if they have relevant contracts.
## Features
### Templates
Content Manager provides various templates for authoring an article. The template should be selected based on the content and audience. The commonly used templates are Technical article (TEC), Drivers and Downloads (DWN) and Product Information (PRD), News and Alerts (NWS) and Working Practice (WP).
The TEC template is used to provide information on how to do something, known issues, and troubleshooting steps. The DWN template can be used to link to a file download such as software updates. It can also be used to upload files which are in .doc, .xls, .pdf formats. PRD helps to provide the product description, and NWS are mainly used to convey a short news item such as the release of a new product, support briefs of a new product. The WP articles are available only for internal customers as these explain the process related to business. It is important to select the correct template as this affects the publishing. The article appears in the Knowledge Library, Support portals and RSS feeds based on the template.
### Sections
#### Title and summary
Content Manager has appropriate sections to provide title and summary of the article. You will need to ensure that the title of the article should be unique and should convey the symptom that the customer is facing. The summary should be a short description of the purpose of the article.
#### The body of the content
For a TEC template, there are sections available to include the symptoms of the issue, cause, requirements to resolve the issue, the procedure section to include the troubleshooting steps, the checks to be done after troubleshooting and also an internal information section, if the author needs to convey anything specific to the internal engineers. For a DWN template, apart from the sections in the TEC template, it has the sections to define the platforms where the download can be installed. Compared to the TEC template, the procedure section in DWN is split into two sections to include the installation instructions and download instructions.
The Relation option helps to link to other articles or downloads so that when a user views this article, it also lists as other articles that might be useful. These are displayed in the Other Useful Articles section at the end of the article.
#### Keywords
In the keywords section, you can include the search terms that are used by the customers. Adding relevant search terms as keywords will help the customer to access the correct article from the Knowledge Library thereby avoiding multiple searches and improving customer satisfaction.
#### Formatting
Content Manager provides the various basic features to make the article more user presentable. You can either use the formatting options such as bold, italics, underline, insert tables and spell check that are available in the HMTL editor or the HTML codes to format the content. You can include images as well as hyperlinks at each section.
### Review and expiry dates
The review date option helps to set a future date to ensure that the article is reviewed and kept it up to date. The expiry date option helps to determine the life of the article. This date is selected based on the end of support of the product.
### Metadata and technical rating
Metadata is the necessary details about the product or the process. You can provide the details such as part number, category and the manufacture details of the product. Moreover, you can rate the article based on the technical complexity and provide access right based on the products. The technical rating will be displayed at the top of every article.
### Access right
You can restrict the contents to a specific audience by providing relevant access rights. These access rights can be linked to the contracts provided the customers. So the contents will be only available to the users based on the contract and products they have purchased.
### Taxonomy
The taxonomies are a set of folders where you can classify and arrange the article based on the products as well as services. During the search, it provides a tree-like structure so that you can filter the articles based on the taxonomy in which the product or services are related to.
### Versioning
It is important to version the content during the documentation. This helps the user to understand the document is updated. The Content Manager contains information on the status of the article, i.e. draft, edited, in approval or live. It also includes the history of the article, e.g. the changes that have been made and the reasons why and the validation comments.
## Conclusion
Content Manager provides an easier way to arrange and manage the content. It helps to ensure that the content is available only to the correct users by restricting it by access rights. Also, it is a user-friendly tool for non-technical users.
